# CubeSudoku
## Rules
Cube Sudoku is to fill colors in a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube with the [Western color scheme](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Western_Color_Scheme).  Once the puzzle is solved, this means that the state is solvable by legal moves (that is, without taking the cube apart again).

## Solutions

Each problem has only one solution. Solution can be accessed after each problem. You can apply the scramble in the solution to your Rubik's cube with yellow on the top and red on the front.
